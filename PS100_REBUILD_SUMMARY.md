**Project Rebuild Completed: June 10, 2025**

## 🎯 Project Overview

This document summarizes the complete rebuild of the solar monitoring system, now specifically optimized for **Anker SOLIX PS100** solar panels with 10A fuse protection.

## 📋 Requirements Analysis

### Original System Issues
❌ **Scale Mismatch**: System designed for milliwatt readings, PS100 produces 100W  
❌ **Calibration Problems**: INA228 showing 0.004-0.005V instead of 26.5V  
❌ **Single Panel Focus**: No multi-panel architecture  
❌ **Inadequate Power Handling**: Current range insufficient for 10A fused system  
❌ **Poor Error Handling**: No graceful degradation or recovery  
❌ **Limited Analytics**: Basic logging without performance insights  

### New System Requirements
✅ **PS100 Optimization**: Designed for 26.5V, 3.77A, 100W panels  
✅ **10A Fuse Protection**: Current monitoring up to 10A with safety margins
